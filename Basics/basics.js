.js is used.
console --> bassed on REPL - Read,Evaluate,Print,Loop.
            consol window basically used for practice purpose 
            To clear the window = ctrl+L 
            upword direction key is used to review previous elements 
            same as lower direction is used to review current elements.
          

variable --> variable is container use as a storage container.
             some values it stores and it's values are as upcomming operations.   
             
Data types --> 

1.Premitive data types-> Number
                         Boolean
                         String
                         undefined
                         null
                         BigInt
                         Symbol

typeof -> is used to show the type of the variable.
ex- a=25
    typeof a = 'number'

    name = "TONY STARK"
    typeof name = 'string' 

NUMBER -> {2,-34,3.5,-54.7,0} are Valid.

Operations-> sum -> a+b
             sub -> a-b
             mul -> a*b
             div -> a/b
             modulo -> a%b = remainder
             exponentiation(power) a**B = means A of power b .
             

NaN -> NOT A NUMBER  -> it represents a number but invalid .
       ex- 0/0
           NaN+1
           NaN-5

Operator Precedence -> ()
                       **
                       *, /, %
                       +, -

let Keyword -> Syntax of declaring variables.
               let a = 5;
               let b = 1;
               let sum = a + b;

               let side = 4
               let areaOfSquar = 4**2;


const Keyword -> values of constants can not be changed with reassignment & they can not be re-declared.
                 ex- const year = 2024;
                     const pi  = 3.14;
                     xonst g = 9.8;

var Keyword -> to define variables.
              ex = var = 9;
              


Assignment operator ->
                     ex -  let age = age + 1; / let age += 1;
                           let age = age - 1; / let age -= 1;
                           let age = age * 1; / let age *= 1;
                           let age = age / 1; / let age /= 1;
                           let age = age % 1; / let age %= 1;
                           

Unary Operator ->  let age++; => increment
                   let ++age; => decrement

                Pre-increment (change , then use) 
                ex- let age = 10;
                    let newAge = ++age; ==> age = 11 & newAge = 11

                Post-increment (use , then change) 
                ex - let age = 10;
                     let newAge = age++; ==> newAge = 10 & age = 11
